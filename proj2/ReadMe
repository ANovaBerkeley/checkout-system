This directory contains a skeleton for CS61B Project 2.

Although some of what's in here might seem mysterious to you, try to 
understand what it's all for.  Don't be afraid to ask us about it.
The skeleton files are YOURS TO CHANGE AS YOU DESIRE OR THROW AWAY
ENTIRELY!!!

Makefile		A makefile (for gmake) that will compile your
			files and run tests.  You must turn in a Makefile,
			'gmake ' must compile all your files, and 
			'gmake check' must perform all your tests.

			that with our skeleton files.  Be sure to keep 
			it up to date.
