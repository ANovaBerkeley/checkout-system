Whenever I write a select statement with or without any conditions, the 
column names become printed. First of all, since column names are not supposed 
to be printed, does that mean that this is technically a row that is being 
printed? And second, I am making the tables into tableiterators in selectclause,
and I am iterating through the tableiterator in the actual select method, 
checking against the conditions and whether each row passes the conditions 
or not. I think the logic is there, but I can not seem to locate the bug 
in the code... Thank you so much for the help!
